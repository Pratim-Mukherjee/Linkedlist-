# Linkedlist-

This repo contains python code for linkedlist

* A linked list is a fundamental data structure used in computer science to store a collection of elements. 
                  It's like a chain of boxes, where each box contains some data and a pointer to the next box in the chain.
                  
* Linked lists provide a dynamic and efficient way to manage collections of elements, especially when frequent insertions and deletions are required.     

* Types of Linked Lists:

i) Singly Linked List: Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
ii) Doubly Linked List: Each node contains data and pointers to both the next and previous nodes, enabling traversal in both directions.
iii) Circular Linked List: In this type, the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

It follows  - FIFO [ FIRST IN FIRST OUT]
